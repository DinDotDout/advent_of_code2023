# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) problems, implemented in Rust.

## Disclaimer

This is my first time using Rust, so the solutions might not be optimal or follow best practices. I'm learning as I go, and I appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

## Structure

Each problem has its own directory named after the day (e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.). Inside each directory, you'll find the Rust code file(s) for that day's problem.

## Running the Code

To run the code for a specific day, navigate to the corresponding directory and use the Rust compiler:

```bash
cd day1
cargo run
